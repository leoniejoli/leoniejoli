# 👋 Hi there, I'm Léonie

## 🧠 Data Scientist | Computer Vision • GIS • Spectroscopy • 3D • Scientific Multimodal AI

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a Data Scientist based in France, with a strong focus on computer vision and complex scientific data.  
I build impact-driven AI solutions across healthcare, agronomy environmental science, and applied research.

### 🌍 Fields I enjoy working on
- 🧬 Medical imaging (segmentation, detection, classification)
- 🌱 Environmental analysis & GIS (satellite imagery, raster/vector, terrain data)
- 🔬 Spectroscopy & chemometrics (IR, UV, NMR…)
- 🛰 3D point clouds, sensor fusion, audio exploration
- 📊 Tabular data & classic machine learning

### 🛠️ Tech stack
`Python` · `PyTorch` · `TensorFlow` · `Keras` · `OpenCV` · `scikit-learn`  
`NumPy` · `pandas` · `SciPy` · `Open3D` · `Librosa` · `QGIS` · `Git` · `Docker`

### 🚧 Upcoming projects here
-  🧠 Open medical imaging models (classification or segmentation)
-  🌍 Deep learning on geospatial data with QGIS
- 🔬 Spectral data modeling for chemical detection
- 🎵 First audio ML experiments (classification, visualization)

### 💡 What I'm looking for
Open to discussions, collaborations or projects related to:
- AI for public health, agronomy, environmental science or open research
- Interdisciplinary R&D (code, field data, real-world impact)
- Or simply sharing ideas around data science, vision, and clean code 🧼
